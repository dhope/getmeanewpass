# Set your working directory to where the file is.

Run:
```{r, eval=F}
install.packages("getmeanewpass_0.1.0.tar.gz", type = "source", repos=NULL)
```

To make your new password type:
```{r}
library(getmeanewpass)
get_me_a_new_password(lengthPass = 5, type = "EFF", nInt = 2)

```


Can change length and number of integers as needed

Don't save your workspace. You should clear it after using `rm(list =ls())` or `Shift-Ctrl-F10` in Rstudio
